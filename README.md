# Python_Bank_Clone
The code we provided is an implementation of a banking system using Python. It presents a menu-driven interface where users can choose various banking operations. Here's a brief description of each section of the code:

1. The code imports two modules, `mymodule` and `Functions`, which contain the necessary functions and classes for the banking operations.

2. The code then enters a loop that will display the bank's menu options and prompt the user to choose an operation.

3. If the user chooses option 1, it prompts for a customer ID and calls the `to_open_account` function from the `Functions` module to open a new bank account. It also creates an instance of the `Bank` class from the `mymodule` module and displays the account details.

4. If the user chooses option 2, it prompts for a customer ID and checks if the customer exists using the `check_customer` function from the `mymodule` module. If the customer exists, it calls the `debit_card` function from the `Functions` module to apply for a debit card.

5. If the user chooses option 3, it prompts for a customer ID and checks if the customer exists. If the customer exists, it creates an instance of the `BankAtm` class from the `mymodule` module and calls the `Atm_machine` method to simulate an ATM machine.

6. If the user chooses option 4, it prompts for a customer ID and checks if the customer exists. If the customer exists, it prompts for an amount and calls the `deposite_balance` method of the `BankAtm` class to deposit the specified amount.

7. If the user chooses option 5, it prompts for a customer ID and checks if the customer exists. If the customer exists, it calls the `update_customer` function from the `Functions` module to update the customer's details.

8. If the user chooses option 6, it prompts for a customer ID and checks if the customer exists. If the customer exists, it creates an instance of the `BankAtm` class and calls the `display` method to show the customer's details.

9. If the user chooses option 7, it prompts for a customer ID and checks if the customer exists. If the customer exists, it creates an instance of the `BankAtm` class and retrieves the customer's information. It then prints the customer's name, account number, balance, and ATM pin.

10. If the user chooses option 8, the program exits.

11. If the user enters an invalid option, it displays an error message.

The code appears to be a basic implementation of a banking system, but without the actual implementations of the functions and classes in the `mymodule` and `Functions` modules, it is difficult to provide further details about the functionality and behavior of the code.
